## Task2.

Supermarket.

Variability:
Within supermarkets there are a variety of variables to take in consideration. Everyday the customer amount, pattern and groceries bought vary heavily from day to day. The inventory might have some changes due to a certain time of the year. Sometimes there might be sudden bulk buying for example 2020 when people were hoarding specific items. You can’t tell how long a checkout could take due to some people using cards or cash and the system could also have problems during the transactions. There could be a shortage of items which cannot be delivered to the markets.

Complexity:
Supermarkets have a lot of different variables which makes it harder to control. There are multiple departments within the supermarket and they all have different items in them and some might not need as frequent replenishment. Some items might have frequent expiring dates or none at all. The prices vary per item and sometimes there might be sales or price drops due to certain items not selling as well. Supermarkets have their own regulations as well that need to be met. You have to take into consideration warehouse space and what to buy and when and also how the vendors work and when they could deliver something to the markets.

Interconnectedness:
There are many interconnected things inside markets. During peak hours if there are less cashiers it will make the lines longer. A sale of paper from my own experience means that the vendors have to be ready to deliver a lot of paper and the supermarket to allocate manpower to distribute and sell them. There is also a need to have and make space for the quantity. The bottle return system will require time to time emptying, checking if there are errors and also maintenance if needed. If the grocery store doesn’t have x item that customer came for, they could leave without buying anything.
